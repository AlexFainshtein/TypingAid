How to use:
0. To check in, use C:\Users\10114976\AppData\Local\GitHubDesktop\GitHubDesktop.exe
1. I edit *.ahk files with Notepad++; There is also a debugger plugin Plugins > DBGp,
   I have not used it actively yet.
2. I DO NOT use C:\GitHub\TypingAid\Build\AHK-Studio IDE -- stopped for now. 
   It seems powerful, but (a) unusual UI and (b) maybe many things do not work 
   (or I use them incorrectly).
3. To "compile" TypingAid.ahk, run C:\GitHub\TypingAid\Build\Ahk2Exe
4. Then, to start compiled version, run C:\GitHub\TypingAid\Build\Bin\TypingAid64-Alex.exe,
   either directly or from Visual Studio, for debugging TAHelper.dll.
5. Another option is to run TypingAid.ahk without compilation, using Run TypingAid.bat (works!)
   and then (not tested yet) to attach to process from VS.


1st checkin.
1. Added TAHelper.dll to process strings in convenient environment.
1a. Meanwhile, I am only adding ellipsis, and this destroys insertion functionality. Need work.
2. Installed debugger plugin in Notepad++; prepared *.bat to run without compilation.
