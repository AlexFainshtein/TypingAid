If I want to adapt this open-source app to my needs, I may drop some complicated features used to support programming languages, auto-corrections etc. This may allow me to simplify interface and expand functionality I want.

What I may want:

1. Key combination to stop/resume recording -- when I enter a passphrase? And show popup: "Not recording"
2. Limit list-of-suggestions contents so it will never has a scrollbar.
2a. Show recently learned words first?
2b. Expose in settings: show learned words only, ignore wordlists.
!3. Merge words with lower and upper case (especially first 3 letters; 3 = # of chars to show suggestions), since they are always typed anyway.
3a. Capitalize end of the word, if the beginning has more capital letters than the stored word.
!3b. If there are only few suggestions, show them after 2 chars, not 3; and show shorter than 6 char words.
4. Show last learned words first.
5. After "complete" action is performed, but I continue typing or editing this word -- learn it too.
!6. If there are more than, say, 10 suggestions (10 = max word# to show), and few of them have 5 or more first characters the same( 5= min char# to show), merge them into one suggestion with ellipsis, and after applying this suggestion expand.
7. Make it portable, on USB (maybe it is already portable). Have a key combination to kill it.
8. > Hitting Page Up will bring you up 10 items, or to the first item. 
   > Hitting Page Down will bring you down 10 items
   I do not need this.
9. > You can permanently learn a word by highlighting a word and hitting Ctrl-Shift-C
   I do need this, but it may be broken. Fix! 
   Actually: if I mistyped the word, it got learned, I'd like to correct and learn it - and 
   forget the mistyped. Can it be done?
10. Save in WordlistLearned.txt words with count - to edit and preserve count.

??. Would it be possible to see the whole text in the app like Notepad++ or browser, and learn nearby words? Na-ah...

Wordlist.txt
WordlistLearned.txt
WordlistLearned.db

INSERT INTO Words (wordindexed, word, count, wordreplacement) VALUES
('ABRUPTLY', 'abruptly', 1, ''),
('ABSOLUTE', 'absolute', 4, ''),
('ABSOLUTELY', 'absolutely', 618, '')
